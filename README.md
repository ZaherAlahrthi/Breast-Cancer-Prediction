# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Brest cancer prediction
The intention of this model is to design a prediction system that can predict the incidence of the breast cancer at early stage
by analyzing smallest set of attributes that has been selected from the clinical dataset. Wisconsin breast cancer dataset (WBCD) 
have been used to conduct the proposed experiment. The potential of the proposed method is obtained using classification accuracy 
which was obtained by comparing actual to predicted values.
